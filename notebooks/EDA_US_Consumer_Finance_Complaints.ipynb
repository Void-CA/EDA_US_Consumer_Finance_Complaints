Review the attached documentation which was sent to each of the aforementioned banks. They detail inaccurate information we were given at he time of hurricane XXXX. The incorrect information was relied upon to make financial decisions we would not have otherwise made. We wrote to each individual bank and have escalated it to the highest level and have filed complaints with the Consumer Protection Agency. We have also filed complaints on-line and made telephone calls directly to each of the credit bureaus. We stated that the information reported by the banks was inaccurate inasmuch as it does not reflect the entire circumstances of events fairly. IT DOES N\\'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. This is a violation of our rights under the, \" fair credit reporting act. \\'\\' During hurricane XXXX both XXXX and XXXX XXXX verbally authorized via the customer service department a Disaster Relief program and/or moratorium of mortgage payments. At that time, neither bank fully disclosed how the waived payments would be repaid. We were told by both institutions that the missed payments would be added to the end of the loan. Both institutions told us after we had already taken part in the moratorium of mortgage payments that they must be paid in full at he end of the waived period. XXXX involvement is limited to having bought the loan from XXXX and has continued to report us late to the credit bureaus. However, since XXXX took over our loan in XXXX 2014 we have not missed or been late with a mortgage payment. Furthermore, if you research the history of loans with XXXX and XXXX XXXX, you will find that we have never been late or missed a payment and we are not in any foreclosure proceedings. However, the past reporting which still remains on our credit report has caused irreparable damage to our credit scores, my employment and our quality of life in general. \\n'\n",

I have asked MoneyGram for a clear answer, however MoneyGram has not been able to provide me with a clear response as to where my money is or what happened. I requested for my money to be reimburse immediately, I was informed today that it will take 10 days in order for me to get my money back, which is something that does not reflect in their policy.

      " \"I originally had a loan with a cosigner with XXXX XXXX loans. This loan is no longer serviced by XXXX loans and has switched to XXXX XXXX XXXX for its servicing. \\n\\nOver the past week and half, starting on XXXX/XXXX/2015, I began receiving phone calls from the Northland Group. When I would answer the phone they would either hang up on me before speaking or would refuse to tell me why they are calling without giving my personal information over the phone. On Thursday XXXX/XXXX/2015, I spoke with supervisor XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. They confirmed with me that my name was XXXX XXXX and phone number that I called in with. I told them they have no permission to call myself, my girlfriend ( who has nothing to do with this loan ) and my father the cosigner. They acknowledged that they will not call me any further. I asked them if they used an auto dialer and they promptly told me that they can not provide me with that information. I advised them that I am aware of the TCPA laws and they have no permission to call my cell phone using an auto dialer. The supervisors refused to speak to me any further and hung up on me. I called back in and spoke to a normal representative, XXXX XXXX, and he advised me they do use auto dialers and that is how I was called. He confirmed that my number should have been removed on XXXX/XXXX/2015 from their auto dialer. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I received another auto dialed call from Northland Group. I tried to call the number back and got a disconnected tone. I called their corporate number and was transferred 8 times to ultimately be disconnected when I requested to speak with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called back through the corporate number and was transferred another 5 times and eventually was directed to XXXX XXXX XXXX 's voicemail. I left a voicemail prompting him to give me a call back. The call was ended. I called back to speak with the supervisor, XXXX XXXX, again having to be transferred multiple times. While trying to reach XXXX, I spoke with another normal representative. I provided her with my name and date of birth and she began to speak to me about my personal private student loan. The amount due and why they were calling me. She advised that the loan was no longer in their office because I had made a payment. When I tried to ask her about why they were calling me in reference to a XXXX loan that was now serviced by XXXX, she said I did not know what I was talking about and refused to answer my questions about the loan. I requested to speak to a supervisor and XXXX XXXX got back on the line. He refused to speak to me or answer my questions. He stated that manager XXXX XXXX would be calling me later that day, XXXX/XXXX/2015, as he had received my voicemail. I asked XXXX to discuss the account with me and would not do so after I verified my date of birth and full name. He stated I had to verify my full mailing address. I advised the previous rep would speak to me and divulge personal non-public information to me after just verifying name and date of birth. He refused to speak to me or answer any further questions and hung up on me. He had stated very clearly that I would receive a phone call from XXXX XXXX, on that day, XXXX/XXXX/2015. I never received that phone call from XXXX XXXX. I did however receive another autodialed phone call on XXXX/XXXX/2015 to my cell phone number. I tried to call the number back, the corporate number, and the New Jersey office line and they all came back as disconnected. I am fed up with being harassed and what this company to pay the consequences for not following TCPA and divulging my personal information after not verifying the correct amount of contact information. This is absolutely absurd they are even in business and they have no right to be calling me or auto dialing my cell phone. Now they wont even allow me to call them to discuss the matter \\n\"]\n",

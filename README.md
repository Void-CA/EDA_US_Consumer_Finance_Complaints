# Data Science Project with Kaggle

## Description

This project encompasses a comprehensive data analysis pipeline, starting from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to the implementation of machine learning models for generating insights from the dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The goal is to explore, clean, and analyze the data thoroughly and develop predictive models to derive actionable insights.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Docker
- Git

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for EDA, analysis, and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `reports/`: Contains visualizations, model results, and insights generated from the analysis.
- `docs/`: Contains project documentation.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests and integration tests for verifying the functionality of scripts and models.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.
- `Dockerfile`: Definition of the Docker image.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker container orchestration.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the Docker image and run the container:
